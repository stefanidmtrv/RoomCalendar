Meetings are always inevitable in the workplace. Most of the students and staff members use
the rooms in the Computational Foundry for work or study. It is inconvenient when a meeting
gets interrupted or when there is no information about the availability of a room. This project
aimed to create software that solves this issue. A web application that can be used on any
device was implemented. A database that stores the data was created, alongside the ability to
manage and alter it. Furthermore, a simple and user-friendly interface was created. The final
product introduces a different approach to implementing a booking system, with the ability to
be expanded in the future
